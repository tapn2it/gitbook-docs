# üìù I Think Therefore I Blog : Deployment

This documentation provides a step-by-step deployment strategy for the "I Think Therefore I Blog" Django walkthrough project provided by Code Institute.

{% hint style="info" %}
This process assumes you have already connected a GitHub account to Render.com. If this is not the case, [follow these steps](../../render.com/sign-up.md).
{% endhint %}

Each step contains a **process,** i.e. the action to be performed in order to make progress, and an **explanation**, a brief description of what value the process adds. Some steps may also contain a **graphic** as an aid.

We encourage you to take time to read the **explanation** at each step. When you are ready, head on to the next page to begin the deployment process.
